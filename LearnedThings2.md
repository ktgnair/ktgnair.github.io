**[Assignment 2](https://ktgnair.github.io/Assignment 2) / [My Experience](https://ktgnair.github.io/LearnedThings2)**

This Assignment also had the same constraints as previous assignment.  
 
The Constraints are as follows:-  
+ Test with very large inputs files, e.g. 5GB.  
+ The program should be robust in that it should be independent of the file size. The memory requirements should be more or less same for input files of varying sizes 1 KB, 5 KB, or 5 GB  
+ Also give memory and speed reading for 1 GB, 5 GB.  

In this Assignment the most important topic that i learned is about Ehcache which was completely new to me and i am also sure that its new for most of the other new programmers.  

Now lets speak about cache memory  


1. Its a high speed memory to increase the speed of processing of the CPU.  
2. Main function of cache memory is to store the copy of frequently used program or data.  
3. There are 3 levels of cache  
  * Level 1  
  * Level 2  
  * Level 3  
4. Level 1 and Level 2 are stored in CPU and Level 3 is stored in motherboard.  
5. Capacity wise Level 1 has smallest capacity say 2-64KB, then Level 2 256-512KB and the last Lvel 3 has the highest that is 1-8MB.  
6. Cache memory is stored in SRAM and main memory in DRAM.  
7. SRAM is expensive as compared to DRAM because SRAM uses 6 transistors while DRAM has only 1 transistors.
