**Open Source**  

Now that you have come to this page you will now get your answers as to why and how people were able to provide help in Linux development.  

The reason is that Linus Torvalds had made the his source code public, the right term is open-source.  

The term open-source refers to something that people can modify and share since it's publicaly accessible.  
Source code is a part of a software which is not accessible to everyone.  

A software which is termed as open-source means that anyone can view the source code, make changes in the source code, do fixes if needed, make improvements and also share it's code.  

So by making the source code readily available to everyone Linus was able to do fixes, implement new things and improve his first version of Linux to a version which is widely used all over the world **Today**.
