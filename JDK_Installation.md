*__Step by Step installation of JAVA JDK.__*   

The steps which will be explained below will help a beginner to install the JDK package on Windows 10.  
JDK package is necessary to run java programs.   

Note:  
Before following the installation steps we need to check if java is already installed or not?  
To perform that check you just need to open your command prompt and type 'javac' command and the resulting output will tell you whether there is a need for you to install the java or not.    

If you notice any error which states that 'javac' is not recognized then you will know that java is not installed in your system.  

<b>Step 1: Download JDK</b>   

You need to download the JDK from internet.  
Just search java jdk in your browser and click on the official link for downloading the JDK  

The official link is the usually the first link as shown in the screenshot below.

On clicking the first link you will be taken to the downloads section(as shown in image 1.1), where you need to select the appropriate version of JDK which you need(as shown in image 1.2). At the time of this tutorial I used JDK 8.  

After selecting the version of JDK as per your need, you will be redirected to another page which has all the downloads for different OS.  
Download the JDK package as per your OS requirements from the list(as shown in image 1.3).
