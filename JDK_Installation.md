*__Step by Step installation of JAVA JDK.__*   

The steps which will be explained below will help a beginner to install the JDK package on Windows 10.  
JDK package is usefull to run java programs.   

<b>But before following the installation steps check if java is already installed or not? To perform that check just open your command prompt and type 'javac' command.  
If you notice any error which states that 'javac' is not recognized then you will know that java is not installed in your system.</b>  

```  
Step 1:      
You need to download the JDK from internet.  
Just search java jdk in your browser and click on the official link for downloading the JDK

The official link is the usually the first link as shown in the screenshot below.

Step 2:  
On clicking the first link you will be taken to the downloads section(as shown in image 2.1), where you need to select the appropriate version of JDK which you need(as shown in image 2.2). At the time of this tutorial I used JDK 8.  

After selecting the version of JDK as per your need, it will be directed to another page which has all the downloads for different OS.  
Download the required exe from the list(as shown in image 2.3).
