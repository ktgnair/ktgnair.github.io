 ## Git Tutorials (_A basic tutorial for people who are new to 'git'_)

### Something about git before starting to implement it :smirk:  

Git is great opensource platform to share the code and to make sure that your code is not lost.  

The main purpose of using git for programmers like us is to sync the local repository with the git server repository.  
Another way of understanding git is lets say you are doing a project and you need to share the code with someone else who can work on their machine and make the updates, so for that you could just share your url with that person and that person will be able to download it or clone it and get started.  

So now that you know something about git _let's begin....._  

I am going to mentions the steps so that you can be familiar with 'how to use git'.  
You can also do it simultaneously while reading as it doesn't take much time to learn the basics afterwards you can explore more if you find this interesting.  

Step 1: 

To install git in your machine (I am using linux, other operating systems might be little different)  
Just type in this command in your terminal.  
```

```

Step 2: 

This is to check whether our git has been porperly installed and to know the version.
Just type in this command in your terminal "git --version"
git version 2.11.0

Step 3: To clone a git repository into git
Go to your directory where you want to clone
cd Documents/Demo/
~/Documents/Demo$ git clone https://github.com/ktgnair/TestGit.git
Cloning into 'TestGit'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.

Step 4: Create an empty file for testing purpose
~/Documents/Demo/TestGit$ gedit gitDemo.txt

Write some content into the text file and save it
To check the contents in the file TestGit just type this command
ls
