**[Assignment 1](https://ktgnair.github.io/) / [My Experience](https://ktgnair.github.io/LearnedThings)**

Overall my experience while doing this assignment was challenging as well as great.

While i was doing this program,i was practically experiencing the most famous English Idiom 'Don't judge a book by its cover'.   After reading the question for the first time i felt whoo now i just need to reverse the file contents but by looking at the program constraints my mind started to look for answers and different approaches.  

The Constraints are as follows:-
+ Test with very large inputs files, e.g. 5GB.
+ The program should be robust in that it should be independent of the file size. The memory requirements should be more or less    same for input files of varying sizes 1 KB, 5 KB, or 5 GB
+ Also give memory and speed reading for 1 GB, 5 GB.
