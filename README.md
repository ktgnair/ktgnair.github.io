Assignment No 1 :
Reverse The Contents of an Input File.

Lets say the input is something like this
Input: “hello world
        I am ktgnair."
        
So the output should be like this
Output: “.riangtk ma i
         dlrow olleh”

As the question said reverse the contents so using fseek() was something that came to my mind.
